# Adanced Linear Regression
> A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price. For the same purpose, the company has collected a data set from the sale of houses in Australia.
> So, the regression analysis has been performed on the dataset to see the most important variables affecting the sales price.

## General Information
Understand and analyse the data to identify the driving factors behind sales price of the houses so that the company can utilize this knowledge for its price prediction model.
The analysis should help the company recognize the important factors which are affectin the sales prioce of the houses.
For the prediction part, Lasso and Regression techniques have been used to see the most important variables which are affeting the sales price.

## Conclusions
- The optimal value of alpha for the Lasso regression is obtained as 0.001 and for the Ridge regression it is 0.1.
- We have chosen the Lasso model with optimum alpha value as 0.001 or lambda value as 1000. We are getting better test R2 score with a simpler model as the lambda value is very high.
